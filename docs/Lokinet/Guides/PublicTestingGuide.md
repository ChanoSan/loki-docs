# Lokinet Public Testing Guide

Thanks for your interest in the public testing phase of the Lokinet alpha. It’s taken many months to get to this point, but we’re grateful to everyone who want to give this new type of mixnet a spin.

This guide will help you get Lokinet running on your machine, and give you some example tasks on things you can do to help put the software through its paces and help us find places where it needs to be fixed or can be improved. The more machines we get this running on, and the more traffic (and types of traffic) we can push through this alpha network, the better.

You can of course run the Loki software on any operating system that you can get it to build on, but for the purposes of this document, the instructions apply to running Lokinet on a remote Ubuntu 16.04 server. If that isn’t what you want to do, syntax and server set up will of course differ according to whatever OS you choose to run the Lokinet from.

## Getting Help and Reporting Bugs Guidelines
The entire purpose of doing a public testing phase is to collect as much feedback as possible. To make this easier for both our testers and the Lokinet team, we ask that our testers stick to the following guidelines.

### Getting Help
If something in this guide isn’t making sense, or if you’re running into issues that you can’t identify on your own, the first place to go would be the #lokinet-help channel on [discord](https://discord.gg/67GXfD6).
