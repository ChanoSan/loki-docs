**Paths**: How one LLARP HS talks to others (like a TOR circuit/I2P tunnel)

**Pathsets**: A collection of paths that one HS use (never fully shared)

**Intro**: How an HS (Hidden Service) says itâ€™s available (like an I2P lease)

**Introset**: A collection of intros that you can use to talk to a HS with extra info (ephemeral NTRU pubkey)

**Router Contact**: is the general info include public key address of a SN (Service Node) (like an I2P router info)
